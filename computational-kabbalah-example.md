# Computational Kabbalah Example

## Living in 5-Dimensional Space

B"H

A core concept in kabbalah is that creation \(which is incidentally concurrent with 'the human experience', as shall be discussed elsewhere\) 'takes place' in a 5-dimensional continuum comprised of:

* The 3 dimensions of 'Space'
  * 'Up" & 'Down'
  * "North' & 'South'
  * 'East' & 'West'
* The dimension of 'Time'
  * "Before" & 'After'
* The dimension of "Spirit'
  * 'Bad' & 'Good'

These 5 dimensions can be expressed by the following model describing of a 5-dimensional vector space as a mapping between a 2-dimensional and a 3-dimensional vector spaces.  

$$
R'5 = R'2 --> R'3
$$

> Time & Spirit are being mapped over 3-dimensional space, forming the reality we know as 'creation'.

We shall discuss in detail the meaning of the 5th dimension, that of 'Spirit", for now consider it as the Tao concept of 'Yin' & 'Yang', 'Giving' & 'Receiving', etc.

These 5 dimensions, each with two endpoints \(meeting at their respective 'points of infinity'\) form the 10 digit structure which is the basis for the 10 Sefirot discussed in theoretical kabbalah and their many manifestations.
